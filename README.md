# Considerations

I confess that I had difficulty with the logic initially and with inspirations for the Timeline! I spent time looking for inspirations on Dribbble and v0. With the short time available, I used Copilot to help me with the grouping logic and focused more on user functionalities.
With more time I would change a bit of the style, especially the Lane and timeline. I would improve the visualization of items in Monthly view.
If I had more time I would test with Jest and Cypress the editing and zoom functionalities.

I'm happy with the result!
